# COVID-and-mental-health

Some notes on what we are trying to accomplish:  

We are aiming to find a correlation between mental health decline and COVID sentiment (per country)
We will accomplish this by:  
* adding alcohol consumption data  
      -normalize it based on country vs amount of tweets (take a percentage)  
      -alcohol vs negative tweets - correlation??  
* *other things that are attributed to lower mental health:  
     -suicides  
     -substance abuse (opiod)  
     -crime  
     -depression  

Possible prototype implementations:  
* interactive heatmap of [variable] vs COVID sentiment  
* word cloud (neutral vs negative vs positive)  
* app interface
